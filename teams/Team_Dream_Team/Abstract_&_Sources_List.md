Abstract

	Virtual reality technology is widely known to be used in pop culture, especially in video games and internet social settings, particularly due to the increasing online presence of our generation. However, there are many other uses for virtual reality, such as in therapy to treat phobias and traumas. Through repeated stimulation of the same trauma or phobia over and over again, patients have shown progress and improvement, suggesting virtual reality can be a great tool in the medical practices, particularly in psychiatric and psychological treatment. This technology also enhances social interactions, and has shown to fulfill social needs. Virtual reality can mold minds in more ways than one. For example, people’s psychology can be changed through VR therapy when treating disorders or mental illnesses, or memories altered by simulating hyper-realistic situations and environments. The question is, what is it about virtual reality that can have such a large impact on our psychology? Does it have something to do with the uncanny valley concept or is there more to it than that? We explore the benefits and advantages of virtual reality technology, and later discuss the possible negative, ethical implications that this technology is currently used for and the future of it.
