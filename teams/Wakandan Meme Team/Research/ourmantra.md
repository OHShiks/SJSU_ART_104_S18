## Main Topic
The development of memes in history and what their equivalents were before memes were a thing.  Why are they prevalent in the united states and why are corporations trying so hard to use them?  

## Argument
Is meme theory some psuedoscientific bs or is it a legitamate form of cultural expression?

## Literature and Interactive Website
* Richard Dawkins made the meme word in the selfish gene book.
* Possibly a p5 sketch to go along with the discussion to demonstrate how the frequency of meme development has changed.
