            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
            The legitimacy and relevance of "meme" culture today will be put into question with regards to how it has become a universal form of cultural expression analogous to other forms in the context of art. With this in mind, this paper will argue in favor of "memes" as a legitimate form of cultural expression contrary to the skepticism that exists due to their generally crude nature. Furthermore, this paper will examine "memes" in their earliest forms prior to the digital age and how the name came to be in the context of Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" and his proclamation of the "Meme". Likewise, the history of Memes and what came before them will bring clarity to their anthropological necessity.  In addition, it is also very important to note the trends of these Memes to emphasize how they reflect the state of our society on a political, social, and aesthetic level.
            </p>
            <h2>A Brief History of Today's Memes</h2>
            <p>Memes can be defined in two ways. One way being an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture. Another definition being an amusing/interesting item(captioned image or video) or genre that is spread on social media where Twitter and Facebook have notably become major hubs for Memes.  Prior to this contemporary scene, the earliest memes that could be observed on the early internet were "The Dancing Baby (1996)" and "The Hamster Dance (1997)".  Meanwhile, Leetspeak was an even earlier form of meme in a written language that originated in the 80s among gamers. Gamers created ironic acronyms to insult players such as n00b, newbies, and pwned, terms that are still used today. Memes likewise would come to become much more as the internet became accessible to people regardless of class.  After that, memes slowly began to grow as technology and accessibility to the internet became more common, with memes such as "Rick Rolling" and Hitler reaction videos from the film "Downfall" making such an impact that they are iconic even today despite their questionably tasteless nature .  With these gems of culture and media in mind, we must ask ourselves how is it that this form of expression came to be?  To start this analysis, the history of cultural expression in general will be used to attribute legitimacy to Memes as  individual units of cultural expression despite arguments against their admittedly insensitive nature at times.  The point however is not their insensibility, rather their ability to retain a still image of what the world looks like at that moment.  This analysis has the goal of asserting that Memes are indeed legitimate forms of cultural expression, due to their relation to local and world events alike,  the analogous nature to classical/political art (or art throughout history) which in some sense were memes of their time, as well as the crudeness of memes actually being part of a broader dialog for the subject of tolerance.</p>
            <h2>Memes as Representations of a Changing World</h2>
            <p>The development of personal computers and the internet, and their availability to most social classes has changed the world. Now, we cannot even question that as the world changes, so does content on the internet, and the medium through which it is expressed. Technologies such as Flash and HTML dramatically changed the landscape of how people interact with the internet. This new extension of web technology paved the way for transmission of culture and overall human behavior. Looking back in time, Richard Dawkins, a world renowned Ethologist, Biologist, and Writer first coined the term meme in much the same way we think of them now.  "When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell" proclaimed Dawkins in a still pre-internet world in 1976.   Looking forward again, this proclamation of the meme remains alive.  The internet iteration of the meme starts incredibly small but with enough relevance, that meme will invade screens on a grander scale. Then it eventually invades our minds where we ourselves propagate the meme out of some anthropological need to imitate each other.</p>
            <p>While at first glance some memes may appear as crude, they closely follow the world we live in such as with natural disasters, social movements, etc.  For instance, the ebola virus outbreak which occurred somewhere around 2014 triggered a response in the meme community with ironic depictions of the virus as an anime (japanese cartoon) character known as "Ebola Chan".  While there is much debate about whether it was a form of comic relief for the horrific nature of the disease or simply "Trolling", there is no doubt that when something has a major impact societally, memes are a natural way to depict world events in an ironic and likewise relatable manner.  Despite the possible argument that internet memes are simply tasteless humor for the sake of attention, it is simplistic to see them for what they are literally and as such, their presence is incredibly important as measurable cultural capital, and as something we will eventually be able to look back on in history books.</p>
            <h2>Classical Art and Pre-Memes</h2>
            <p>So what came before the phenomenon of the meme?  In context, memes contain exactly the same intention of cultural expression that artists in the past had when depicting the world of that time. Likewise, although contemporary memes are seen in formats such as images, video, or text, older art mediums still accomplished very much the same thing in their historical contexts.  Imagery of traditional mediums likewise found its way around the word even without the insane amount of international connectivity we have now.  For example a work of Graffiti art known as "Kilroy was Here" fit the bill for an early meme in the way it was propagated.  "Kilroy was Here" was a piece of graffiti that became popular during World War II. It featured a cartoon with a dangling nose over a wall with the words "Kilroy was Here" and it in a way became a sort of phenomenon that could be observed around the world. Servicemen during the war found the doodle scribbled onto walls of their stations. Very little context was given with regards to the original piece, but it spread in many places around the world and people would attribute their own meaning to that iteration of the piece much like we see now with memes on the internet such as "caption memes".</p>
            <p>Another excellent example brings us back to pre revolutionary France as well as revolutionary France where there was massive criticism of the Monarch Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette who seemed to be using financial resources in a very questionable manner.  It is however not the criticisms that are of immediate attention with regards to the memetic subject.  The often lewd cartoon art which in some ways haunted the royal family to the bitter end was an excellent way of recording the events which took place in France at the time.  Notorious art related to the monarchs also included the depiction of their deaths, all of which were shown in a very ironic crude manner.</p>
            <h2>Memes Today</h2>
            <p>Rather than being simple caricatures, memes have evolved into a complex body of language. Compared to Kilroy, these new memes are more widespread and pop up into everyday conversation. It has become almost a rat race to produce memes as fast as possible on any topic.  There seems to be no rules where a comedic finesse is expected, and so long as the newly generated meme iis memorable and laughable, it will garner attention from the masses.  As mentioned before, memes have in some way become a media outlet due to their reflection of our time. As time progressed, memes had evolved into a sort of caption based culture where scenes of movies or appropriate reactionary images of arbitrary people became common suit for meme propagation.  But today, we are seeing an even more unique phenomenon which is the crossover of memes and art for the highlighting of social issues.  In order to understand the approach that some Memes are now taking, we must first understand how it is that art has approached certain social issues.</p>
            <p>Art according to the Art Print Express website is defined as a medium to help us express ideas and to help share information. Throughout history art was used to express what was going on during the time. If a war was going on in the country or elsewhere in the world then some artists would reflect that in their work to spread awareness about what was going on.  Art itself is classified into a very diverse set of categories according to "The Role of the Arts and Culture in Planning Practice" .  In the context of this analysis, these unique mediums of art often have the same goal which is to bring awareness about an issue or a specific topic.  In particular, Graphic Design and Digital Media Art alike make heavy use of technology and specifically internet culture as they go hand in hand as mediums which depend on rich digital content.  With these ideas in mind, we should take note of some works that are stereotypically digital in nature but make use of contemporary meme techniques to propagate a meaning.</p>
            <p>In 2016, a single meme on facebook generated a widespread interest in hemp plastic, as evidenced by google trends. It was originally posted on a facebook page called End the Drug War and it garnered more than 350,000 shares in a short time. The upper part of the picture depicted marine animals trapped in plastic, while the lower part depicts the decay process of a hemp plastic bottle which takes place in a total of 80 days. Other notable memes in this category includes a remarkable picture involving an African American woman, Leshia Evans resisting authorities in a protest in Louisiana. This took place some days after 37 year old Alton Sterling was shot and killed by the police in Baton Rouge. She was arrested later and taken away after refusing to leave the area. What made the meme so striking was the fact that she stood right in front of them dressed up like she was on her way to a dinner date.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Memes have often been overlooked as merely a part of popular culture, but today memes have pervaded almost every aspect of society. They can be comical, political, sexual and even religious but above all memes have the power to make media more tangible to a universal audience. Their popularity has even led to countless meme generating websites all over the internet. The world of memes is a world where free speech and opinions collide, from images of presidents, celebrities, and animals, to even more serious issues like race, gender, public health issues, etc.  Memes bring us together in the sense that we share them as though personal murals of our personas. They are almost always relatable and have mirror-like capabilities. Mirror-like capabilities in the sense that you see a part of yourself in them and enjoy the excitement that  they bring, or conversely you may feel compelled to act in some way if they evoke feelings of sorrow.  Regardless, if you are a skeptic that only feels memes to be what they appear as, you must consider that their vastness speaks for them in that they will always be a means to express a portrait of the world we live in and those who live in it with us.</p>
