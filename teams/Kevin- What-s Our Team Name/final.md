Drones: A fictional look at the realities of UAVs. Two stories exploring global realities of drones.


Cetacean Rehabilitation

Abstract 1: 

While the concept of drones may seem newfangled to Americans, their uses have become more realized in recent years. From package deliveries to news traffic coverage, remotely controlled drones are allowing us to vicariously traverse of the skies— and the seas. Willie, a humpback whale extending 44 feet living only miles off the shores of Monterey Bay, California, was inspected and led to safety by a series of six-propeller hexacopters collecting data over the Atlantic. Cetacean rehabilitation is being aided by artificial intelligence algorithms poetically and proactively absolving the seas of marine terrorism— of invasive toxins massacring our world's most complex ecosystem. Our new reality—a world wherein we will soon gaze up to the heavens and see a structure of drones bustling about—will ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally aware future.


Essay 1: 

While the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may seem newfangled to Americans, their uses have become more realized in recent years. Package deliveries to news traffic coverage, remotely controlled drones are allowing us to vicariously traverse the skies— and the seas. At its core, a drone is nothing more than an aircraft sans human pilot. Originally, drones were developed and deployed for military-only functions, UAVs have entered the consumer marketplace as of late. Handheld drones hover around suburban cul-de-sacs, assist in the production of Hollywood films, and bathe regions in public internet access. Our new reality—a world wherein we will soon gaze up to the heavens and see a structure of drones bustling about—will ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally aware future. One such example of where UAVs are a welcomed prescience is off the puissant coastline of Monterey Bay, California.  

One was a misty Monday morning on the sharp shores of Moss Landing three oceanographers stood huddled around a mechanical engineer on his knees tightening one of the six rotors on a drone the size of a bicycle tire. The cup of coffee in one of the oceanographers hand so hot it appeared to be keeping the group warm. Within minute the battery-operated flying contraption was hovering above the four youthful professionals— its hum like an orchestra of bees fighting for breath in a hive. Kevin, one of the oceanographer clad in a fleece Patagonia vest was operating the aircraft from a book-sized instrument perched upon his chest, suspended by a large strap around his neck. Within moments the drone was nothing but a faint blue light disappearing into the morning sun. The four smiled widely as their two year collaboration hit the skies for the first time since rigorous FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), FCC (Federal Communications Commission), and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) testing approvals green-lit the project. 

Results from this flight enterprise won’t be available, if proven successful, for over a  week. The hexacopter launched from Moss Landing will spend the next several days searching out large aquatic mammals such as whales and dolphins. As soon as the aircraft is one mile off-shore Kevin’s piloting sting will be over. The drone will use of combination of cellular signals, satellite GPS data, onboard SONAR (SOund Navigation And Ranging), and imaging cameras to share its location with the team members and locate cetaceans as it hovers only several meters above the lively Pacific Ocean. Once targeted ocean life is located the UAV will drop an aspirin-sized microcontroller into the mammals blowhole. The fortunate bestial of interest in this study is Willie the Whale. Kevin and his team of oceanographers met Willie recently on a fishing boat tour of Monterey Bay. He is a humpback whale extending 44 feet long, weighing almost as much as three school busses. The team realized the dangers of sending human beings into the ocean to interact with these monstrous creatures. Drone deployment is their primary hope to forestall a modern-day Jonah headline. 


Imagine a net of drones existing overhead the 70% of earth concealed with water. There are no wires or ropes forming this net, but merely a massive global network bridging continents—constantly monitoring the invisible blue planet. UAV networks could monitor the largest territories on Earth.It's described by a new term called autonomous things (AuT). AuT drones utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence to navigate themselves, and even to make more advanced decisions such as tracking wanted criminals, delivering online orders, geographic mapping, and even forming with other drones to create 4-dimensional visual display in the sky. Server farms of the distant future will rely on these aerial networks to distribute the load of a changing internet paradigm. In rural areas drone fleets will provide broad cellular service, possibly becoming the backbone of future mobile networks— becoming the aerial of infrastructure of our connected world. 

Picture lying in a park and gazing to the heavens to watch a 4D movie. Artificial neural networks will allow UAVs to meet, and eventually exceed human intellect while adding a 3rd person view on life. Integrated artificial superintelligence. Drone networks high above our city streets will forever ameliorate the way we do commerce, abolish poverty, and advance our society into a globally dominant future. 





Nation Annihilation

Abstract 2: 

The purpose of this paper is to give a first-person account of a society where soldiers are no longer needed to be present as war erupts. Soldiers will no longer be in danger of confrontation or worry about enemy attacks or civilian uprisings. Instead they will be miles away only looking through a screen directing and maneuvering drones to do what once a soldier’s presence was needed for. Like playing a video game, emotions are replaced by the number of attacks one can achieve; like fulfilling a monthly quota.  Unaware of who is on the other side of the screen labeled as a target. Since there is no mental preparation for combat there is also no emotional connection, no fear, no worries, no pain, no empathy. The victims, labeled as targets, are left alone to carry the unimaginable burden of their own fears— the nightmare screams of the injured and images of the dead around them. Leaving them with the only refuge they have left, their thoughts. 


Essay 2:

As I leave the explosions from my hometown I see bombs drop from drones a mile away. As I run off into the sunset I hear screams all around as I near my shelter from the loud noise. I see new drones here arrive to my village as more screams are heard. I think of drones forcing me to leave behind what I cherish— soldiers nowhere to be seen as death comes from the skies. As war in my country ravages it becomes easier for the foreign powers to take down targets marked with red on their monitors. A world that depends on drones to execute military objective can be its own downfall as drones are susceptible to being captured and used against their own operators. Maybe I am exaggerating that drones can easily be hacked and create an all out drone warfare but sometimes it feels like it will come true. One does not need field experience to know that seeing these drones take out targets makes us feel powerless

All of us have grown to fear drones over these long years as they show no mercy to us. The human is never there as the drone eliminates us as though we matter less in life than their families back home. The latest version of these drones require not even a human operator— rather autonomously seeking “high-risk” targets and dropping missiles and bombs. It has become clear than these unmanned war machines are not unaware of who the actual targets should be. My only hope to redeem this land is to clear these droid infested skies. 

Going through this danger of drones hovering over us, watching us, could end very badly. I know that there are people in my country who oppose of my belief of sparing human life. Some think of violence as the only way to spread their beliefs. Drone warfare is cleaner for the opposition, but its effects are catastrophic. When we can, we go on social media to get see the devastation that has struck our country. I read stories new drones that are silent and invisible from the ground.  


It is only a matter of time before soldiers and government aid is no longer present. My country is but one of the many victims in this war. I hear many stories of drones patrolling everywhere. My cousin was killed last year in a strike. Innocently, he was in the field working to support his family. My daughter can no longer hear from her left ear as the sound of an explosion permanently damaged her ear. We can hide, but are not hidden. We can run, but are not fast enough. We pray, but we are not heard. Our freedom does not exist anymore. 


“Tomorrow we will eat well again”

I’m Awake,
I keep my eyes closed.
Someone is holding my left arm,
I’m awake.
I don’t want to open my eyes.
I look to my left. I see my wife holding my son and my son holding my arm.
The sun is rising. I can see it through the crack in the wall.
Last night we ate bread and rice with herbs. We’ve been saving this meal for a special occasion.
We ate well last night.
My son, stuffed with food, could hardly walk. It's been a while since we ate so well.
My wife and I laughed. For a brief moment we felt safe. Free.
I walk outside.
I close my eyes.
Our neighbors are moving away.
Far away to other cities and countries with family.
This is our home. What little we have is our home; my family.
There is no one else.
Last week at the market I bought some bread for the week.
On my way home, I stopped to help a neighbor pack his things to move. 
In return he gave me herbs and rice. He is moving south to safer territory.  
He overheard the foreign military using new drones, destroying cities and villages with no human control.
My town is small; only getting smaller. I know everyone.
They are some of the greatest people.
I smell the burning of wood coming from my home. 
It’s already morning and my wife is preparing breakfast.
I see my son standing at the doorway looking at me. He is only six. 
My wife joins him. 
I smile at the sight of them— they are wonderful and beautiful.
The only reason to keep going. 
I walk over to them and feel their warmth.
I see dust coming our way.
I embrace them harder.
Tomorrow we will well again.
