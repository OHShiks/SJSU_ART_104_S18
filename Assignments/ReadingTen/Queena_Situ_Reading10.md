Holochain is similar to blockchain in the sense that it uses a network of data to become more effective and efficient. However, with holochain technology, rather than blocks of data being calculated and sifted through on a server, essentially, a program or application becomes more efficient the more people are using them. There is no server and essentially the data is shared between clients and applications. It's kind of difficult to understand for me. I find this topic more difficult to understand than blockchain technology. It's outside blockchain and is something unique. It's effectiveness and efficiency depends on its users rather than, for example, graphics cards that are currently being used to go through tons of data to mine cryptocurrency. However, what also makes Holochain different from blockchain is, instead of using the old architecture of creating a unique code for an interaction or process, holochain in itself is its own "ID" for users. What this means is it prevents data from being stolen, shared, or duplicated without the creators permission. I'm not well versed with this kind of technology, but it seems very useful in this day and age where tons of data is being networked and shared on the internet.
